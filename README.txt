README

To compile the program, navigate to the directory that contains the assignment (/1979734_OOSEAssignment)
and type in "ant" in the terminal. This only works if you compile with ant within the directory.

In order to run the program, type in "java -jar CombatGame.jar" and hit enter.

THINGS TO MENTION
The program currently has "shop.txt" hardcoded into the FileIO class. It will only work with that file name.
An implementation for the future would be to make it so that the user enters a file name and that particular
file will be read in and used as shop data.

If the program cannot find a file called "shop.txt", it will continue to run the program but print out an error
message.
No functionality will work due to error checking.

Within /19798734_OOSEAssignment contains:
    - Report
    - UML diagram
    - build folder which contains a src folder with .class files for my model, view and controller
    - build.xml
    - CombatGame.jar 
    - Declaration of Originality
    - README.txt (you are reading it!)
    - shop.txt 
    - src folder which contains the .java files for my model, view and controller

Enjoy!
